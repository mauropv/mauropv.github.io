## About 
I am currently a [Ph.D. student](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/MAURO-PIVA_nP1532581_IT.aspx) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.di.uniroma1.it/) of Sapienza University of Rome, under the supervision of Prof. Gaia Maselli. My research interests lie in the field of wireless networks, with an emphasis on RFID and ultra low power sensors.
